# junit5-kotlin
Extensions for Junit5 for Kotlin programming language

## SealedClassesSource
Creates instances of sealed classes for `@Parametrized` tests

Usage:

```kotlin
@ParameterizedTest
@SealedClassesSource
fun test(item: SomeClass)
```

Can handle: 
- nested sealed classes
- singletons `object`
- empty constructors 
- constructors made out of primitive types

You can pass in a `TypeFactory` for creating custom instances like for mocking

You can extend the `DefaultTypeFactory` for creating custom instances while reusing the creation of constructors with single paramter constructors with basic types and empty constructors.


```kotlin
sealed class Fruit {
  object Orange : Fruit()
  object Banana : Fruit()
  data class Apple(color: String) : Fruit()
}

class FruitTypeFactory : DefaultTypeFactory() {
    override fun create(what: KClass<*>) = when (what) {
        Apple::class -> Fruit.Apple(
            color = "red"
        )
        else -> super.create(what)
    }
}
```

Filter: 

You can filter out a few values by using the names attribute.

```kotlin
sealed class Family {
    class Mother: Family()
    class Father: Family()
    sealed class Children: Family() {
        class Son: Children()
        class Daughter: Children()
        sealed class GrandChildren: Children() {
            class GrandSon: GrandChildren()
            class GradDaughter: GrandChildren()
        }
    }
}

@ParameterizedTest
@SealedClassesSource(names = ["Mother", "Daughter", "GrandSon"])
fun test(item: Family)
```
Or you can turn this around by setting the mode attribute to EXCLUDE

```kotlin
@ParameterizedTest
@SealedClassesSource(names = ["Mother", "Daughter", "GrandSon"], mode = SealedClassesSource.Mode.EXCLUDE)
fun test(item: Family)
```

Get it:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'de.jodamob.junit5:junit5-kotlin:0.0.1'
}
```
